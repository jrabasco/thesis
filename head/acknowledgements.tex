First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor, Michele Catasta. He was able to show direction and provide useful advice while being patient and open minded. This project was made to be inspiring and challenging for me thanks to his work and vision.\\
I would also like to thank my comrades from the laboratory. Be it because of your presence and cheerful discussions which helped keeping me motivated or your direct contributions to the project, you all helped me deliver this work.\\
Finally I thank my family and friends. You have all been a great source of support. But on top of this, I had an incredible response to the public trials which was entirely made possible because of you.
