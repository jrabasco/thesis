\section{New reactions}
Since the 24\textsuperscript{th} of February 2016\cite{reactrelease}, Facebook has introduced new ways people can express their reactions to a post they see on their feed. These reactions complement the "Like" reaction which has been for years the only reaction people could express. The five new reactions are "Love", "Haha", "Wow", "Sad" and "Angry". These reactions represent slightly new ways the people using the platform can express their feelinds. It is important for this project to take those into account as they provide more insight into the ways people remember their life. These new reactions are therefore now collected by the latest version of ReminisceMe and we created a new question especially for it (in addition to the obious ones we could generate following the same patterns as the "Like" reaction before): ordering the reactions on a post based on their number. This would tell us if people remember well or not if the impact of a certain post was mostly negative or positive.
